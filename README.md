# Description

## 1. Choose number of Sequences
In the option bar on the right, you can choose between 2 or 3 sequences to compare. If you choose 2 Sequences, you are able to choose between different Algorithms, if you choose 3 Sequences, it will automaticly choose the global alignment algorithm.

## 2. Choose the algorithm (only for 2 sequences)
The are multiple algorithms to choose on in the option bar:
### a) Needleman-Wunsch
Description

### b) Needleman-Wunsch with linear space
Description

### c) Smith-Waterman
Description

### d) Gotoh
Description

## 3. Choose the substitution matrix
### BLOSSUM
If you want to compare amino acids, you can choose one of the following substitutions matrix: blossum 45, blossum50, blossum62, blossum80. Large numbers like blossum80, are designed for more related Proteins, where as small numbers like blossum45 are designed for distantly related proteins. These substitution matrices contain values, which score the replacement of on amino acid with another or a deletion. For more information, read the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLOSUM .
### Custom Matrix
choose matchscore, mismatchscore and gapscore. Add a description what these means in the result.

## 4. Choose view (only for 2 sequences)
Choose between regular view or minimalistic view.

## 5. Display all results



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
